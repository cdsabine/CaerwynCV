# CaerwynCV
Repo with code for my CSS CV

Target user profile:

This CV, identical to my actual CV of which this website is based off, was designed to be given to businesses that worked with and around the water and coast. This CV was used specifically to get me a job working at Club Nautic Estartit, where the majority of my work experience comes from. It has be designed utilising colours that one could find at the coast, and imagery that reflects where the majority of my work took place. It includes a snapshot of one of my projects that I've undertaken, a study of GPS tracking and the practical aplications it has in the marine world, and also mentiosn my experience in racing sailing ships of different kinds.

It is also worth mentioning however, that this CV has also been used to secure me positions of an academic type. My skills teaching customers to sail was easily transformed, also thanks to my mother tounge, into the ability to teach young children english. Because of this, I've also included a part of my CV which demonstrates my ability to teach people of any age a variety of different topics and skills.

Putting all of this together, my CV has been designed to be shown to companies that usually specialise in some form of teaching, and are usually invovled in activites on the coast, however this is not a restricting factor, as someone working at an English acadamy could also benefit from reading my CV.

Information architecture:

The design of my CV is one that is dynamic and flexible. It includes links to relevant social media, and also has an imbeded video file that allows for the user to get to know me slightly, and see what recent projects I've undertaken. It utilises a FLEX design, thus allowing for it to be scaled to whatever screen you are viewing it on (it is worth mentioning however, that the screen I designed it on is 2560x1440 and thus, if there are any issues, please take this into consideration). The code is divided into relevant blocks (however I do feel that the main information blocks could be joined even more, as some formatting is repeated unnecessarily), and it is clear and easy to read. 

Visual design:

My CV has been designed following the pricipal of 2 parts split, with one taking up roughly 2/3 more than the other. The smaller column contains simply a photo of myself, some general information and links to socials, and an imbeded video. The larger column contains all of the more pertinent information, including parts of interest such as Knowledge, Experience etc.

   COLOUR PALETTE:  My page has been designed utilising a custom colour palette that gives off an essense of the sea and costal areas. Created using coloor, the                           palette is as follows: 1C2321 7D98A1 5E6572 A9B4C2 EBEAE5. All of these colours fit wonderfully with the general theme of the sea, and are                             pleasing and calming to look at.                      
    
In the following link, you can see a mock up of the CV before it was built, one that I used as a guide to accelerate the design process.
